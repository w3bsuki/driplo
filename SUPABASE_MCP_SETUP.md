# Supabase MCP Setup Issue

The Supabase MCP server requires a Supabase Access Token, which is different from the service role key. 

## To Get Your Access Token:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Generate a new access token
3. Copy the token

## Then Update Configuration:

Once you have the access token, we can update the MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "supabase": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
      "--project-ref=guqjihzgnnzdsyxntnvd"
    ],
    "env": {
      "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternative Approach (What We'll Use Now):

For now, we'll use the Supabase JavaScript client directly in our code, which works perfectly with your existing service role key. This gives us the same functionality without needing MCP.

The implementation plan remains the same - we'll just query Supabase directly from our server-side code instead of through MCP.
