# Threadly Master Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan breaks down the Threadly PRD into small, manageable phases with focused tasks. Each task is designed to be completed in 1-2 hours maximum, with continuous review and iteration to prevent technical debt.

## Core Principles

1. **Start Small**: MVP with only essential features
2. **Incremental Development**: Small, reviewable chunks
3. **Zero Technical Debt**: Review and refactor continuously
4. **No Bloat**: Only implement what's needed
5. **Mobile-First**: Every feature designed for mobile

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Task:

1. **Plan** - Review requirements and dependencies
2. **Implement** - Write clean, minimal code
3. **Test** - Verify functionality works
4. **Review** - Check for code quality issues
5. **Refactor** - Improve if needed
6. **Document** - Add necessary comments/docs

### Code Quality Checklist:

- [ ] TypeScript types are strict and complete
- [ ] Components are responsive mobile-first
- [ ] No console.logs or debug code
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Loading states are implemented
- [ ] Accessibility is considered
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Security best practices followed

### Review Points:

- End of each day: Review code for quality
- End of each week: Architecture review
- End of each phase: Full system review

### Progress Tracking:

- Mark tasks as complete when done
- Add notes for any deviations from plan
- Document any technical decisions made
- Track time spent on each task
- Note any blockers or issues

### Next Steps:

1. Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript
2. Setup development environment
3. Begin Phase 0 implementation

This plan focuses on building a solid foundation first, then incrementally adding features. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring we maintain quality throughout development.
